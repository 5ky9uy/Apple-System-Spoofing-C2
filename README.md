# AppleSystemSpoofing-C2

This repository documents an active post-exploitation infrastructure leveraging Apple system services and iOS framework spoofing. The findings are based on direct observation of anomalous device behavior, C2 traffic patterns, and spoofed native components intended to evade detection.

## Summary

- Date Identified: August 20, 2025  
- Targeted Platform: iOS (SpringBoard, MediaRemoteUI, accessoryd, others)  
- Technique: Bundle ID spoofing, memory-resident binaries, TLS-based C2  
- Traffic Profile: Low-noise, encrypted over port 443 (TLS 1.3), obfuscated SNI  
- Detection Status: Previously undocumented; evidence of stealthy persistence and native process abuse

## Key Findings

- Command-and-Control (C2) using TLS 1.3 over port 443 with obfuscated hostnames (e.g., Hostname#5f52027b)
- Bundle ID impersonation involving com.apple.mobileassetd.client.*
- Resolver manipulation and dynamic memory tampering observed in crash logs
- Suspicious key rotation in Bluetooth and HomeKit pairing identities
- Indicators suggest use of reflective binary loading and lifecycle hijack techniques

## Attribution Statement

Observed behaviors partially align with commercial surveillance platforms, red team toolkits, and known APT techniques targeting iOS/macOS environments. No definitive attribution is made at this time.
